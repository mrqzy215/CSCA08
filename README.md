# CSCA08 2025 Winter Project

This is a set of assignments from the University of Toronto Scarborough (UTSC) for the course CSCA08 (Introduction to Computer Science I). Feel free to explore and learn from this Python project. Itâ€™s definitely challenging for beginners with no prior programming experience, but you will gain valuable insights once you go through the learning process.

These are my submitted solutions for the three assignments, which were worth 7%, 10%, and 14% of the final grade respectively. I received an A- or B+ for these submissions.

**PLEASE DO NOT COPY THIS CODE DIRECTLY. These files contain my original submissions, and copying them will likely lead to plagiarism issues and may not even yield the correct answers. Use them for learning and reference only.**

Good luck with your first-year studies!
